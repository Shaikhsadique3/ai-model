- SDK events (real-time behavioral data)

## 4. Model Output

**Risk Probability**:
- A score between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of a customer churning.
- Higher scores indicate a greater probability of churn.

**Risk Categories**:
- **Low**: Probability < 0.3
- **Medium**: Probability between 0.3 and 0.7
- **High**: Probability > 0.7

**Additional Signals**:
- `predicted_days_to_churn`: Estimated number of days until churn (for high-risk customers).
- `trigger_flag_for_automation`: Boolean flag to initiate automated retention workflows.

## 5. Training Data

**Data Sources Used**:
- **Synthetic SaaS Datasets**: Generated data mimicking typical SaaS customer behavior and churn patterns.
- **Anonymized Historical Data**: Past customer data from various SaaS platforms, anonymized to protect privacy.
- **Kaggle Churn Datasets**: Publicly available datasets related to customer churn prediction.

**Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Steps**:
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Handled using mean, median, or mode imputation based on feature distribution.
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding for nominal features, ordinal encoding for ordinal features.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization (Z-score normalization) applied to numerical features.
- **New Feature Creation**:
  - `tenure_months`: Duration of customer subscription.
  - `login_frequency`: Average logins per month.
  - `support_interaction_rate`: Ratio of support tickets to tenure.

**Handling of Imbalanced Data**:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Used to oversample the minority class (churned customers) to balance the dataset.
- **Class Weights**: Adjusted class weights in the model training process to give more importance to the minority class.

## 6. Model Architecture

**Algorithm(s) Used**:
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: A powerful and efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosted decision tree algorithm.

**Why this Algorithm was Chosen**:
- **High Performance**: XGBoost consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance on tabular datasets, which are common in churn prediction.
- **Robustness to Overfitting**: Incorporates regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, crucial for models deployed in production.
- **Feature Importance**: Provides clear insights into feature importance, aiding interpretability and further feature engineering efforts.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets and can be parallelized for faster training.

**Feature Importance Examples**:
- `last_login`: High importance, indicating recent activity is a strong predictor of retention.
- `tenure_months`: Moderate importance, showing longer-term customers might have different churn patterns.
- `support_ticket_count`: High importance, suggesting customer issues are a significant churn driver.
- `monthly_revenue`: Moderate importance, indicating higher-value customers might be more stable.

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results among all positive results (true positives + false positives).
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of true positive results among all samples that should have been identified as positive (true positives + false negatives).
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
- **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve)**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes. A higher AUC indicates a better model performance.

**Confusion Matrix Overview**:
- A table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.
  - **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted churn.
  - **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted non-churn.
  - **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted churn (Type I error).
  - **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted non-churn (Type II error).

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Recall prioritized over Precision**: In the context of churn prediction, it is often more critical to identify as many potential churners as possible (high recall) even if it means a few false positives (predicting churn for customers who won't). This approach allows for proactive intervention strategies to retain at-risk customers, minimizing missed churn cases.

## 8. Performance Summary

**Current Performance Baseline**:
- Approximately 80% accuracy when using only basic billing and login data.

**Improvements with SDK/Feature Data**:
- An additional 10-12% improvement in overall model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) when incorporating SDK events and detailed feature usage data.

**Improvements with Support/Reason Clustering**:
- A further 5-7% improvement in performance when integrating support ticket data and clustering cancellation reasons, providing deeper insights into customer sentiment and issues.

## 9. Limitations

**Cold-Start Users**:
- The model's predictive accuracy is lower for new signups with limited historical data, as there isn't enough behavioral information to make robust predictions.

**Missing Product Usage Data**:
- The model's performance can be impacted by the absence of comprehensive product usage data, which is a strong indicator of user engagement and satisfaction.

**Dependence on Data Quality**:
- The model's effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the input data. Inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the source data can lead to biased or incorrect predictions.

## 10. Ethical & Privacy Considerations

**Data Anonymization**:
- All sensitive customer data used for training and prediction is anonymized and de-identified to protect individual privacy.

**GDPR/CCPA Compliance**:
- The model development and deployment adhere to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) guidelines, ensuring data privacy and user rights.

**Fairness and Bias Considerations**:
- Regular audits are conducted to identify and mitigate potential biases in the model's predictions, ensuring fair treatment across different user segments.
- The model is designed to avoid discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes.

## 11. Continuous Improvement Plan

**Retraining with More Founder Datasets**:
- Regularly retrain the model with new and diverse founder datasets to improve its generalization capabilities and adapt to evolving user behaviors.

**Adding Feedback Loops from Automation Results**:
- Implement feedback mechanisms from automated actions triggered by the model (e.g., targeted interventions) to continuously refine prediction accuracy and effectiveness.

**Benchmarking Against Industry Standards**:
- Periodically benchmark the model's performance against industry-leading churn prediction solutions and best practices to identify areas for further optimization and innovation.
